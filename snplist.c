/* Triglav performs the following operations: */

/* 1) Generates a SNP list for every input file in your genomic sample pool */
/* 2) Extracts variants based on each of these SNP lists */
/* 3) Merges all extracted variants into one final file */

/* Triglav outperforms the standard vcf-merge utility found in vcftools, */ 
/* which typically gives rise to problems when merging indels with normal */
/* vcf files.  Also, vcftoolsâ€™ vcf-merge utility only takes the first values */
/* from the list of merged vcf files, thereby affecting other post-analysis */ 
/* scripts such as `VQSR` for downstream filtering of the data. */
